# GIS 3: Lab 7

Package development in R
*R Packages* by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan 
Chapter 2: The Whole Game

The package created, using the instructions in the text and the lab video this week, includes one function and one dataset. 

The function, fbind, catenates two factors and returns a factor in character format. 
The dataset "PS06" shows Medicaid expenditure by state in 2019. This data is sourced from the GeoDaCenter's github repository, opioid-policy-scan, which can be found [here](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/opioid-policy-scan/blob/master/data_final/PS06_2019_S.csv).
